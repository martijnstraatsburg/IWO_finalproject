# Running the shell-script(s)!

Go to the directory where the scripts are stored.

Type the following command in the terminal and run it, to get the results of January 15th 2013:

You have to change the numbers '1234567' after the 's' to your own Karora login!

```bash
ssh s1234567@karora.let.rug.nl bash < abusive2013.sh
```

and run the following command to get the results of January 15th 2018:

```bash
ssh s1234567@karora.let.rug.nl bash < abusive2018.sh
```

Enter your own Karora password and the script will print all frequencies for the 15th of January in either 2013 or 2018.

The results of the scripts are in 2 different .txt files.
